# GeoIP Attack Map — Configuration
# ==================================
# Copy this file to config.toml and adjust values for your environment.
# config.toml is excluded from git — never commit it with real server details.
#
# All settings below show the default values used when config.toml is absent
# (matching the  Docker environment). Omitting a key keeps its default.
